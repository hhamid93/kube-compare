# Rationale

The “kubectl cluster-compare” command is capable of performing an intelligent diff between a reference configuration and
the specific configuration applied to a cluster. The comparison is capable of suppressing diffs of content which is
expected to be user variable, validating required and optional configuration, and ignoring known runtime variable
fields. With these fields suppressed the user is able to focus on the remaining diffs which are more
relevant/potentially impactful to the use case. With these capabilities a cluster administrator, solutions architect,
support engineers, and others can validate a cluster’s configuration against a baseline reference configuration.

# Concepts

## Reference Configuration

The target of `kubectl cluster compare` tool is to detect deviations from a live or local set of CRs with respect to a Reference Configuration specified by a set of recommended Custom Resources (CRs).

But first, what do we understand by Reference Configuration? The Reference Configuration consists of a set of CRs and an entry-point which defines the expected mandatory and optional components. This entrypoint is a YAML file called `metadata.yaml`.

- A Reference Configuration is typically versioned to account for necessary differences in the configuration based on the specific cluster version.
- The top level (entry point) of the reference configuration is the metadata descriptor YAML file (`metadata.yaml`). This file defines the Reference Configuration.
- A published `metadata.yaml` identifies the set of compliant Reference Configuration CR objects for the covered use case. Any differences in cluster configuration found when running the `kubectl cluster compare` tool shall be identified as a deviation from the expected Reference Configuration.  

For guidance on the Reference Configuration defined by `metadata.yaml` see
[this guide](./ReferenceConfigGuide.md).

## Optional vs required

## CR selection (correlation)

The "kubectl cluster-compare" tool works by iterating across the CRs found in the reference configuration and finding
CRs from the users configuration (live cluster or collection of CRs) which should be compared to the
reference. Typically the relevant user CRs have unique names or are contained in user defined namespaces. The tool
correlates reference CRs to user CRs as described in this section in order to account for the expected variatoins in
naming without requiring the user to explicitly map reference to cluster CR.

### Correlating CRs

`kubectl cluster-compare` must correlate CRs between reference and input configurations to perform the
comparisons. `kubectl cluster-compare` correlates CRs by using the apiVersion, kind, namespace and name fields of the
CRs to perform a nearest match correlation. Optionally the user may provide a manual override of the correlation to
identify a specific reference configuration CR to be used for a given user input CR. Manual matches are prioritized over
the automatic of correlation, meaning manual matches override matches by similar values in the specified group of
fields.

#### Correlation by manual matches

`kubectl cluster-compare` gets as input a diff config that contains an option to specify manual matches between cluster
resources and resource templates. The matches can be added to the config as pairs of `apiVersion_kind_namespace_name:
<Template File Name>`. For cluster scoped CRs that don't have a namespace the matches can be added as pairs of
`apiVersion_kind_name: <Template File Name>`.

#### Correlation by group of fields (apiVersion, kind, namespace and name)

When there is no manual match for a CR the command will try to match a template for the resource by looking at the
4-tuple: apiVersion, kind, namespace and name . The Correlation is based on which fields in the templates that are not
user-variable. Templates get matched to resources based on all the features from the 4-tuple that are declared fixed (
not user-variable) in the templates.

For example a template with a fixed namespace, kind, name and templated (user-variable) apiVersion will only be a
potential match by the kind-namespace-name criterion.

For each resource the group correlation will be done by the next logic:

1. Exact match of apiVersion-kind-namespace-name
    1. If single result in reference, comparison will be done
1. Exact Match in 3/4 fields from apiVersion, kind, namespace, name. ( meaning exact match in: kind-namespace-name or
   apiVersion-kind-name or apiVersion-kind-namespace)
    1. If single result in reference, comparison will be done
1. Exact Match in 2/4 fields from apiVersion, kind, namespace, name. ( meaning exact match in: kind-namespace or
   kind-name or apiVersion-kind)
    1. If single result in reference, comparison will be done
1. Match kind
    1. If single result in reference, comparison will be done
1. No match – comparison cannot be made and the file is flagged as unmatched.

We can phrase this logic in a more general form. Each CR will be correlated to a template with an exact match in the
largest number of fields from this group:  apiVersion, kind, namespace, name.

## How it works

- eg how templates pull content into reference prior to compare

## Limits

## Single CR scope

This tool provides a context aware diff function. In some cases the reference may further provide validation of values
in the CRs. This validation operates within the scope of a the current CR. Any validation of values across multiple CRs
is out of scope.

## CR validation

This tool performs a diff of a CR against the reference. It does not have access to resources outside the scope of what
is available through the cluster's API. This places validation of the configuration against underlying platform
hardware, os configuratoin, etc (unless available through the api) out of scope.

# Example use cases

To Compare a known valid reference configuration with a live cluster:

`kubectl cluster-compare -r <referenceConfigurationDirecotry>`

To Compare a known valid reference configuration with a local set of CRs:

`kubectl cluster-compare -r <referenceConfigurationDirecotry> -f <inputConfiguration>`

To Compare a known valid reference configuration with a live cluster and with a user config:

`kubectl cluster-compare -r <referenceConfigurationDirecotry> -c <userConfig>`

To Run a known valid reference configuration with a support archive output:

`kubectl cluster-compare -r <referenceConfigurationDirecotry> -f "must-gather*/*/cluster-scoped-resources","must-gather*/*/namespaces" -R`

# Understanding the output

## States of a Reference Configuration CR after running the tool

After running `kubectl cluster-compare` tool, the reference configuration CRs will be identified in one of the following states: missing and present in the live cluster.

1. Missing CR. A `missing` reference CR can be in the following state:
    1. Required: Reference CR is required and does not appear in the target cluster CRs. Note that a missed reference CRs declared as optional is not going to be reported as missed.

2. Present CR. A `present` reference CR can be in one of the following states:
    1. Matched once: The reference CR has one correlated instance in the live cluster.
    2. Matched more than once: The reference CR has more than one correlated instance in the live cluster. There are additional reference CRs in the live cluster with equivalent apiVersion-kind-namespace-name.
    3. Present and unmatched: The reference configuration CR is present, which means that there is a match for api-kind-name-namespace, in the target cluster but does not follow some configuration value specific to the live cluster. This should be identified as a deviation.

# Options and advanced usage

## Kubectl Environment Variables
The tool is responsive to KUBECTL_EXTERNAL_DIFF environment variable (same as kubectl diff). This allows you to tailor the output formatting to suit your preference. 

-y : side by side comparison
--color: colored output
-W <char_width>: width of char_length

For more available options do diff --help

side-by-side comparison (total width 150 characters) with:
`KUBECTL_EXTERNAL_DIFF="diff -y -W 150"`

# Troubleshooting

## False Positives

### Reference Designs CRs may change (or not) from one cluster version to another version
The tool sometimes reports CR to be missing completely while in the live cluster environment the CR is present. This can happen at times because the tool is not correctly identifying the operator versions of these CRs or template's critical fields don't match cluster CRs.

#### Example #1:
```
Missing required CRs: 
Template-Reference:
  ExamplePart:
  - Example-Component-CR.yaml
  - Example-Component-CR.yaml

[cluster]$ kubectl get example-component -A
NAME                      AGE
example-component-name   5d20h
[cluster]$ kubectl get console -A
NAME                      AGE
example-component-name   5d20h
```
#### Example #2:
```
Cluster CR
apiVersion: ExampleVersion
kind: ExampleKind
metadata:
  name: $x-name
  namespace: ExampleNamespace
  
Template CR
apiVersion: ExampleVersion
kind: ExampleKind
metadata:
  name: $y-name
  namespace: ExampleNamespace
```

In such scenarios take these steps:
1. Ensure you are using the lastest version of tool
1. Ensure you are using the most up-to-date version of the reference configuration.
2. Ensure that template has the same api-version-kind-name-namespace as the cluster CR.

### There can be more than one Reference Design CR of the same Kind

In this case you will have a warning presented before the diff output, formatted similar to this:
`W0402 15:19:36.531169 3578413 corelator.go:144] More then one template with same apiVersion, metadata_name, metadata_namespace, kind. These templates wont be used for corelation. To use them use different corelator (manual matching) or remove one of them from the reference. Template names are: XConfig.yaml, YConfig.yaml`

This means the template contains two CRs with the same apiversion-kind-name-namespace but different spec. In such cases comment out the template CRs from the metadata.yaml that are more accurate with CRs under comparison.
